## Accessing Objects

Hello and welcome to Jurassic Park! You have been brought on to manage the dig sites for Dr. John Hammond. No expense has been spared, and the data on each mine is currently stored in the javascript objects below.

```js
var snakewaterMontana = {
  paleontologist: "Dr. Alan Grant",
  depth: "10 meters",
  specimen: "Velociraptor"
}
```

- Create a variable called guestOfHonor and assign it's value to the name of the paleontologist at Snakewater, Montana.
- Access the value of the specimen found in Snakewater, Montana, and store it in a variable called cleverGirl. 

```js
var nicaragua = {
  depth: "200 meters",
  annualBudget: 1500000,
  specimens: [
    "Tyrannosaurus Rex",
    "Stegosaurous",
    "Triceratops",
    "Velociraptor"
  ]
}
```

- Make a variable called favoriteSpecimen and assign it's value to your favorite dinosaur within nicaraguanSpecimens.
- Add 250000 to the annual budget of this site.

```js
var hammondsMines = {
  buenosAires: {
    depth: "400 meters",
    annualBudget: 1000000,
    specimens: [
      "Dilophosaurus",
      "Brachiosaurus"
    ]
  },
  mexico: {
    depth: "350 meters",
    annualBudget: 900000,
    specimens: [
      "Gallimimus",
      "Parasaurolophus"
    ]
  }
}
```
